# Pizza-Radar-for-Football-Player-Analysis

This project demonstrates how to create a comparative pizza radar to evaluate a football player against others in the same position and competition. The analysis uses player performance data from the Premier League, processed in Python.

#### Objectives

1. Import and clean player performance data.
2. Filter players by position for meaningful comparisons.
3. Convert key stats into percentiles.
4. Generate a pizza radar visualization to compare a target player with the rest of the group.

#### Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes Premier League player statistics. 
Values are filtered to include only defenders, with Trent Alexander-Arnold as the target player.

#### Tools & Libraries

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. mplsoccer
6. Scipy
7. seaborn
8. statsbombpy

#### Output

- A comparative pizza radar displaying the player’s percentile rank across selected performance metrics relative to other defenders in the league.

#### Purpose

- This visualization helps identify strengths, weaknesses, and performance profile differences between players in the same role, providing support for tactical and scouting analysis.
